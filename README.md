## Hi there 👋

My name is Ivan, and I'm a master's student and research assistant at TU Wien interested in all things Python & Data Science.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on semantic segmentation in aerial imagery with deep learning, and developing an agent-based model (ABM) for public transport systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering with Python, and system design for machine learning in production.
- 💬 I’m looking to collaborate on all things data and AI. [Let's connect!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanbabiy/)
